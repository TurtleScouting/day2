        <p>This page is about the world famous <strong>Generic Sports Team</strong>. In 1972 a crack commando unit
      was sent to prison by a military court
      for a crime they didn't commit.
      These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade
      to the Los Angeles underground.
      Today, still wanted by the government,
      they survive as soldiers of fortune.
      If you have a problem,
      if no one else can help
      and if you can find them
      maybe you can hire the A-team...</p>
